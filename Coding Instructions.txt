1) Build your snake by inheriting SnakeNavigator (Reference BattleSnake.Library.dll)
2) Place your compiled DLL in the same folder as BattleSnake.exe
3) Run BattleSnake.exe
4) Delete other Snake DLLs if you want to test your own snake by itself
5) *You can copy the same DLL multiple times to test your snake against itself*
